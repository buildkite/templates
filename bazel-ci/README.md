# Building with Bazel

This template gives you a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that runs on any Bazel project.

At a glance:

- For [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) projects
- Builds and runs tests

## How it works

This template:

1. Builds the project with Bazel.
2. Runs tests with Bazel.

## Next steps

After you select **Use template**, you’ll:

1. Connect the Git repository with your Bazel project.
2. Set the build and test parameters for your Bazel project.
3. Configure the compute—run locally, on-premises, or in the cloud.
4. Run the pipeline.

You can then play around with the pipeline settings. For example, run the pipeline locally while you iterate on the definition or set a schedule to trigger a nightly build.
