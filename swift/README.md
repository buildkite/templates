# CI for Swift with Linting, Testing, and Building

This template gives you a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that lints, tests, and builds a Swift application.

## How it works

This template:

1. Lints the Swift code with SwiftLint.
2. Runs tests with Xcode.
3. Builds the application with Xcode.

## Next steps

After you select Use template, you’ll:

1. Connect the Git repository with your Swift application.
2. Modify the commands if necessary.
3. Configure the compute—run locally, on-premises, or in the cloud.
4. Run the pipeline.

You can then play around with the pipeline settings. For example, run the pipeline locally while you iterate on the definition or set a schedule to trigger a nightly build.
