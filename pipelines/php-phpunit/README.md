# CI/CD for PHP with Linting, Testing, and Building

This template gives you a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that lints, tests, and builds a PHP application.

At a glance:
- For PHP applications
- Uses PHP's built-in linter
- Uses PHPUnit for testing
- Uses Composer for building
- Deploys to Packagist

## How it works

This template:
1. Lints the PHP code with PHP's built-in linter.
2. Runs tests with PHPUnit.
3. Builds the application with Composer.

## Next steps

After you select Use template, you’ll:
1. Connect the Git repository with your PHP application.
2. Modify the commands if necessary.
3. Configure the compute—run locally, on-premises, or in the cloud.
4. Run the pipeline.

You can then play around with the pipeline settings. For example, run the pipeline locally while you iterate on the definition or set a schedule to trigger a nightly build.
