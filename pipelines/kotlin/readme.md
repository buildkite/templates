# CI/CD for Kotlin with Linting, Testing, and Building

This template gives you a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that lints, tests, and builds a Kotlin application.

At a glance:

- For Kotlin applications
- Uses ktlint for linting
- Uses Gradle for testing and building
- Deploys to Maven Central

## How it works

This template:

1. Lints the Kotlin code with ktlint.
2. Runs tests with Gradle.
3. Builds the application with Gradle.

## Next steps

After you select Use template, you’ll:

1. Connect the Git repository with your Kotlin application.
2. Modify the commands if necessary.
3. Configure the compute—run locally, on-premises, or in the cloud.
4. Run the pipeline.

You can then play around with the pipeline settings. For example, run the pipeline locally while you iterate on the definition or set a schedule to trigger a nightly build.
