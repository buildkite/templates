# CI/CD for Ruby with Linting, Testing, and Building

This template gives you a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that lints, tests, and builds a Ruby application.

At a glance:

- For Ruby applications
- Uses RuboCop for linting
- Uses RSpec for testing
- Uses Bundler for building

## How it works

This template:

1. Lints the Ruby code with RuboCop.
2. Runs tests with RSpec.
3. Builds the application with Bundler.

## Next steps

After you select Use template, you’ll:

1. Connect the Git repository with your Ruby application.
2. Modify the commands if necessary.
3. Configure the compute—run locally, on-premises, or in the cloud.
4. Run the pipeline.

You can then play around with the pipeline settings. For example, run the pipeline locally while you iterate on the definition or set a schedule to trigger a nightly build.
