# CI/CD for Rust with Linting, Testing, and Building

This template gives you a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that lints, tests, and builds a Rust application.

At a glance:

- For Rust applications
- Uses Clippy for linting
- Uses Cargo for testing and building

## How it works

This template:

1. Lints the Rust code with Clippy.
2. Runs tests with Cargo.
3. Builds the application with Cargo.

## Next steps

After you select Use template, you’ll:

1. Connect the Git repository with your Rust application.
2. Modify the commands if necessary.
3. Configure the compute—run locally, on-premises, or in the cloud.
4. Run the pipeline.

You can then play around with the pipeline settings. For example, run the pipeline locally while you iterate on the definition or set a schedule to trigger a nightly build.
