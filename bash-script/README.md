# Run a Bash script

This template gives you a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that runs a Bash script to print a message in the build logs.

At a glance:

- Uses [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- Defines the script inline

## How it works

This template:

1. Prints a message in the build log.
2. Uploads an artifact.

## Next steps

After you select **Use template**, you’ll:

1. Connect the Git repository with your code.
2. Configure the compute—run locally, on-premises, or in the cloud.
3. Run the pipeline.
