# This is an example for how to test a python project using Buildkite, Docker, and pipenv.
# Your repository will need to contain a Dockerfile to setup the pipenv environment and install dependencies. Additionally, you will also need to separately define `app` within a `docker-compose.yaml` file in your repository. For more information see: https://github.com/buildkite/python-docker-example

steps:
  - name: ":python:"
    command: "Suggested command: py.test"
    plugins:
      - docker-compose#v3.0.3:
          run: app
