# This is an example Buildkite pipeline for running a simple bash script. You will need to define a script in your repository and put the path within the command step below.
# To print the artifacts from `artifact_path` you will also need to define this within your repository.
# For more information, see: https://github.com/buildkite/bash-example

steps:
  # Label to show in the build pipeline.
  - label: ":hammer: Example Script"

    # `script.sh` is a suggested path to run a script of the same name defined within your repository
    # For an example, see: https://github.com/buildkite/bash-example/blob/master/script.sh
    command: "script.sh"

    # File paths for the artifacts to be automatically uploaded after the step has run (e.g. tmp/**/*.png). Separate each path with a semi-colon.
    # For an example using the bash-example, see: https://github.com/buildkite/bash-example/tree/master/artifacts
    artifact_paths: "artifacts/*"

    # Agent Targeting Rules
