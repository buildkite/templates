# CI for Kotlin using Gradle

This template gives you a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that builds and tests a Kotlin application using Gradle.

At a glance:

- For [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) applications
- Uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) for building and testing

## How it works

This template:

1. Runs tests with Gradle.
2. Builds the application with Gradle.

## Next steps

After you select **Use template**, you’ll:

1. Connect the Git repository with your Java application.
2. Modify the commands if necessary.
3. Configure the compute—run locally, on-premises, or in the cloud.
4. Run the pipeline.

You can then play around with the pipeline settings. For example, run the pipeline locally while you iterate on the definition or set a schedule to trigger a nightly build.
